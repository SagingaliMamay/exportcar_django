# Welcome to my project build in Django Framework for car dealers.
####  This web app is designed to help car dealers manage their inventory, sales, and customers. With a user-friendly interface and powerful features, this app can streamline your workflow and increase your sales.

The app allows to car dealers recieve a car proposition from particular & enteprise for buy and to easily add, edit, and remove cars from your inventory. You can include details such as make, model, year, mileage, price, and features. You can also upload photos and documents to give potential buyers a clear view of the vehicle.

The app also includes a search and filter function, which allows car dealers to quickly find the cars they are interested in based on criteria such as make, model, price, and location from database. The car dealers can also create custom fields to capture additional information about each car, such as VIN number or vehicle history.

In addition to managing the inventory, the app also helps track your sales and customers. You can record customer details, such as name, phone number, and email address, and track the status of each sale.
The app is built on the Django framework, which means it is highly scalable, secure, and customizable. It also includes built-in authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
